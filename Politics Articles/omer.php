         <p id="articleinfo">India has condemned the visit of US Congresswoman Ilhan Omar to Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir (PoK) and said it reflected her 'narrow-minded' politics.<br><br>India on Thursday condemned the visit of US Congresswoman Ilhan Omar to Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir (PoK) and said it reflected 'narrow-minded' politics. Omar, who is on a four-day visit to Pakistan, had visited former prime minister Imran Khan at his residence.External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi criticised Omar for visiting PoK and said, "We have noted that she has visited a part of the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir that is currently illegally occupied by Pakistan. Let me just say that if such a politician wishes to practice her narrow-minded politics, that may be her business.""But violating our territorial integrity and sovereignty in its pursuit makes this ours and we think the visit is condemnable," he added.<br><br>To another question on recent terror attacks in Afghanistan, MEA said, "We have seen some of the terrorist attacks. We have always been forthright in our condemnation of terrorist attacks. We are looking at what the developments have been there. We certainly condemn all terrorist attacks."<br><br>Reacting to the allegations of interference by Indian high commission in academic freedom of Australia, Bagchi said, "We have seen media reports which are not accurate. We have think tanks for deepening the relations. In Melbourne it was a specific case. Institute was set up by Australian government and funded by them. Indian government does not fund the institute and does not have any say in its functioning."Speaking on India's stand on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, MEA spokesperson said India's position on war has been put forward by MEA.
