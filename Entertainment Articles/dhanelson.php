The talented director is next directing Superstar Rajinikanth, and the film's pre-production work is heading well. Now, the latest report rounding on the internet says that after Rajinikanth, it's Dhanush for Nelson Dilipkumar. Nelson Dilipkumar will be reportedly joining hands with Dhanush after delivering 'Thalaivar 169' with Rajinikanth.<br><br><br>The director has also reportedly taken the first step by narrating a one-liner to the actor. But it looks like Dhanush hasn't decided on the project as he already has hands full of films.Rajinikanth was said to be looking for a replacement for Nelson Dilipkumar to direct 'Thalaivar', but the actor's side has denied the report calling it a rumor. Rajinikanth has also updated his Twitter cover picture with the 'Thalaivar 169' announcement picture and indirectly confirmed that the film is on. Meanwhile, Nelson has also added the hashtag #Thalaivar169 in his bio to confirm the same, and the rumor which tried to develop big got extinguished at the first step. The shooting of 'Thalaivar 169' might take time as the director has to finalize the full script for the film.
