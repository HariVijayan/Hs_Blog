         <p id="articleinfo">IPL 2022 highlights, RR vs MI: Tim David held his nerve after a brilliant partnership between Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma as Mumbai Indians ended their eight-match losing streak in IPL 2022. MI beat Rajasthan Royals by 5 wickets at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai on Saturday. Chasing a target of 159, MI lost Rohit Sharma early. Ishan Kishan played a brisk cameo but was out for 26. It was Suryakumar and Tilak that brought the MI chase back on track. Ravichandran Ashwin's cameo in the end had provided the finishing touches to the RR innings as they posted 158 for 6. Jos Buttler was the top scorer with 67. Earlier, Mumbai Indians captain Rohit Sharma won the toss and opted to chase.<br><br>A good, collective bowling performance from MI had restricted Rajasthan Royals to 158/6. Kumar Kartikeya, the debutant left-arm spinner, was impressive and returned with 1/19 from his four overs. Riley Meredith worked up good pace, hit Jos Buttler on the helmet with a sharp bouncer and bagged 2/24.<br><br>Then, MI chased down the target via an 81-run third wicket partnership between Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma. There were jitters in the camp when Surya perished after scoring a 39-ball 51 and Varma departed a couple of deliveries later. Even in the final over, when only four runs were required for victory, Kieron Pollard’s dismissal had kept MI on the edge. But Daniel Sams hit the first ball he faced for a six and the MI fans were dancing in the aisles.<br><br>Earlier, Buttler’s purple patch continued, as he scored 67 off 52 balls. About a month ago, at DY Patil Stadium, he had scored a 68-ball hundred in the Royals’ first-leg fixture against MI. Pitches were fresh then. Surfaces have become a tad jaded now. No wonder that Buttler’s innings today, at the same venue, against the same opponents was different. For a substantial period, he went at less than run-a-ball before hitting four consecutive sixes against Hrithik Shokeen. Ravichandran Ashwin scored an enterprising 21 runs off nine balls and unleashed all his variations while bowling. But it was MI’s night.
