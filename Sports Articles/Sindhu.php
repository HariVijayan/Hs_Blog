         <p id="articleinfo">It will always escape the dour medal-counters of Indian sport – those who get hung up on suffixes to attach to PV Sindhu – just how precious her value is, to sport’s biggest metric: capturing eyeballs on a day-to-day basis. Capturing and holding them steady in the now, in the present. Sindhu was born for television.<br><br>Her game, the contests that reach the critical mass of excitement before exploding into fireworks and how an opponent gets snared into a duel entirely of her making, is the stuff of sporting spectacle that Olympic sports crave, in between Games years. Badminton, with its widely whimsical broadcast schedules, where fans across the world are scrambling for livestreams of early rounds, lucks out when top players hit the tube. In her 10th year since her first major medal – the bronze at the 2013 World Championships, what’s remained unchanged is Sindhu’s ability to add a zing of natural theatrics to every contest, making her amongst the most prominent of pivots, the most happening gig at any tournament.<br><br>The inflection-point in the quarterfinals of the Badminton Asian Championship in Manila – which Sindhu edged 21-9, 13-21, 21-19 – came at 16-14 in the decider against Chinese left-hander He Bingjiao. There is a whiff of controversy about whether it was actually 16-15, as the Chinese who was trailing, claimed. But the lead-up to that point was no less dramatic.
