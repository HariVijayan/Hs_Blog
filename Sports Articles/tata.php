Tata will remain the main sponsor as Vivo still has two years in its IPL title sponsorship contract. BCCI Secretary Jay Singh said the board along with the Tata Group, is looking forward to taking Indian cricket and the IPL to greater heights. The IPL was launched in 2008, initialised by the then BCCI vice-president Lalit Modi, and has gained popularity over the years. Indian Premier League has turned out to be one of the biggest sporting leagues in the world and has attracted millions of fans. The league has also been most attractive for several tycoons to bag title sponsorship rights of the lucrative event. In a span of 13 years, IPL has had various title sponsors. Let’s take a look at all the title sponsors for the IPL seasons over the years.<br><br>Vivo (2021) <br>Dream11 (2020)<br>Vivo (2018 - 2019)<br>Vivo (2016 - 2017)<br>Pepsi (2013 - 2015)<br>DLF (2008 to 2012)
