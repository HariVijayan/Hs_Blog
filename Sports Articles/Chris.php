         <p id="articleinfo">Veteran point guard Chris Paul did everything he could to help his Phoenix Suns take care of the New Orleans Pelicans and advance to the second round of the NBA playoffs. That included establishing a curfew for his team.<br><br>During a Friday episode of the Brian Windhorst & the Hoop Collective podcast, Windhorst said Paul set up rooms in the team's hotel to watch playoff games and play cards. The players were allowed to go out around the city, but Paul expected them back at the hotel by a specific time.

It's understandable Paul did not want to take any chances for distractions, especially since star teammate Devin Booker suffered a hamstring injury during Game 2 of the series, leaving the Suns without their leading scorer until Game 6.<br><br>Phoenix is on a serious mission to make it back into the NBA Finals after losing to the Milwaukee Bucks on that stage last year.
