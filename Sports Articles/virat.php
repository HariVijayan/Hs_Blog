         <p id="articleinfo">Less than three months after he decided to step down as skipper of India's T20I and ODI teams, Virat Kohli has relinquished the captaincy of the Test side.<br><br>Almost four months after he informed of his decision to step down as skipper of India's T20I team, Virat Kohli has relinquished the captaincy of the Test side. The groundbreaking announcement from Kohli, who was in December removed as India's ODI captain, comes a day after India's 1-2 Test series defeat to South Africa.<br><br>Kohli steps down as India's most successful Test captain of all time, having led the team to 40 wins from 68 matches with an impressive win percentage of 58.82. This is most by any skipper with more than 10 Tests as captain, way ahead of MS Dhoni, Sourav Ganguly and Mohammed Azharuddin, who captained India in 60, 49 and 47 Tests respectively. Kohli also ends his captaincy career as the fourth most successful Test skipper of all time in terms of wins behind Graeme Smith (53), Ricky Ponting (48), and Steve Waugh (41) in terms of wins "It's been 7 years of hard work, toil and relentless perseverance everyday to take the team in the right direction. I've done the job with absolute honesty and left nothing out there. Every thing has to come to a halt at some stage and for me as Test Captain of India, it's now," Kohli said in a release issued on Twitter.
